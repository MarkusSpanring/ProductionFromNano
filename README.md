# ProductionFromNano

Tools for running WAW ntuple production from NanoAOD by CMS

Port of [tools by A. Kalinowski, M. Bluj et al. based on KLUB/LLR trees](https://github.com/akalinow/Production.git) to CMS NanoAOD

---

* NanoEventsSkeleton.{h,C}: interface to NanoAOD ntuples produced from NanoAOD with MakeClass tool, it needs be updated after each modification of NanoAOD format.
* HTauTauTreeFromNanoBase.{h,C}: base class to translate to WAW format
* HMuTauhTreeFromNano.{h,C}: specialization for the mu+tau channel
* HTauhTauhTreeFromNano.{h,C}: specialization for the di-tau channel
* HTTEvent.{h,cxx}: definition of WAW analysis classes
* PropertyEnum.h, TriggerEnum.h: definition of enums, (re)generated by the tool
* AnalysisEnums.h, SelectionBitsEnum.h: definition of enums
* convertNano.py: script to run conversion
* Missing: production tools, need be taken modified from old repo
